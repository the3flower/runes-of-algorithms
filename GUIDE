This is Guide by Me, for entry level.

Which part should I focus?

// Hold my beer kid, I will tell you which part I focusing on

1. Ask yourself, which part do you want to go
- in this case i focusing on SE or Developer

2. DSA and Problem Solving
- In every interview need this type of knowledge
    a. Pick some language that you want, strict with that lang
    b. Learn syntax of lang
    c. Do basic math question
    d. Grind leetcode, you will stuck leetcode for sure but you need to gather some little information/knowledge like
        DSA and try to apply it to question

3. Build some SHIT
- This part focusing on building project/product by doing
    a. Pick some stack (What is stack? Search Google plsssss zzzzz)
    b. Start from easy project with your stack
    c. Push your project to GitHub
    d. You will learn:
        - Gathering Requirement: in this case you are not gathering but try to think about requirement how your system work, what is the purpose of your system etc.
        - (optional) System Design, Database Design, etc.: This is optional, you research and do it for second project. FYI: if you do this process for your very first project its a bit of wasting time, just my opinion
        - Test: You will learn how to test you feature or your product, it is not optional but must do
        - Version Control: I recommend to use GitHub, and you need to do it boy

4. Database

5. Cloud
