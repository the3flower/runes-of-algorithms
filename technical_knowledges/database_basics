SQL Command:
    Syntax Order:

        SELECT column1, column2, ...
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition
        GROUP BY column1
        HAVING condition
        ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC]
        LIMIT number;

        SELECT      → Specifies the columns you want to retrieve.
        FROM        → Specifies the table from which to retrieve data.
        WHERE       → Filters the rows based on a condition (must come before ORDER BY).
        GROUP BY    → Groups the rows based on a column.
        HAVING      → Filters grouped rows (used after GROUP BY, unlike WHERE, which filters individual rows).
        ORDER BY    → Sorts the result (must come after WHERE or GROUP BY).
        LIMIT       → Restricts the number of rows returned.

        Example:
            SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
            FROM employees
            WHERE salary > 50000
            GROUP BY department
            HAVING AVG(salary) > 60000
            ORDER BY avg_salary DESC
            LIMIT 2;

        Example, compare normal values with unique values:
            SELECT COUNT(CITY) - COUNT(DISTINCT CITY) FROM STATION;

        Example, length and ORDER BY can have chain/double abilty omfg, nice to know LOL
            SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY)
            FROM STATION
            ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) ASC, CITY ASC
            LIMIT 1;

            SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY)
            FROM STATION
            ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC, CITY ASC
            LIMIT 1;
